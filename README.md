# My personal React-Redux boilerplate for fast start developing on React

***
## Under the hood:
1. Webpack
2. Babel (ES6/ES7 support)
3. Redux (with pretty dir's structure for actions, reducers, containers and components)
4. React-router
5. Hot Module Replacement with codespliting and dev-server
6. SASS preprocessor with Bourbon framework
7. ngrok for tunneling localhost
8. ... and much more

***
## How to make it work?
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install` in terminal
3. Run `npm start`
4. Go to http://localhost:8080 (HMR will immediately work)
